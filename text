<h3>to the unknown</h3>
<p>Maboneng is thought to be the home of many artists and too few galleries, but this changed with the arrival of the exhibition space, a place where the meaning of art is considered to be the meaning of the artist.
    Located in the Maboneng Precinct, the gallery focuses on the curation and rotational exhibitions of young and established African contemporary artists. Their signature showstoppers include the hosting of curated events for individuals or corporates that use all four floors of the building.
